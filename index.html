  <h1>Donate cho tôi nếu bạn cảm thấy web này hữu ích</h1>
  <h4 class="subtitle">The author behind <a href="wasabixxx.github.io">Method of Action</a></h4>

  <p>I hope you've enjoyed my work<sup><a href="#p1">1</a></sup>. These games and tools were created over the span of eight years, self-financing the time and resources required to design, program, and maintain them. Attempts at monetization have always been met with inner resistance, for a couple of reasons.</p>

   <p>Advertising nowadays is the implicit commerce of privacy, and it inevitably compromises the quality of the product. Furthermore, my only brush with advertising <a href="https://7labs.io/technology-news/subdomain-leasing.html#Proof_of_Subdomain_Leasing_Period_8211_Historical_DNS_Records">got me burned</a>. The alternative—gating content behind a paywall—blocks sincere students because institutions don't account for this kind of educational material.</p>

  <p>It is in this spirit that I ask for donations, to finance more time to do the things that I love without questions like <em>how am I going to make money out of this</em> shaping the product. It is said that when the product is free, then the user is the product, yet <a href="https://method.ac/writing/articles/we_dont_value_your_privacy.html">I refuse take this stance</a>.</p>

  <p>Instead, let us frame your donation as a gift of <em>freedom</em>, one of the highest virtues in my book, and for that I am deeply appreciative of your generosity.</p>

  <p>Truly yours,</p>
